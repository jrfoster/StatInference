##Overview

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that if we repeatedly take independent random samples of size n from any population, then, when n is large, the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution.  In this report, we investigate the CLT by simulation using R to generate random independent samples of the exponential distribution.

##Simulations

The exponential distribution is defined as follows:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e ^ {- \lambda x} \qquad x > 0, \lambda > 0
$$
